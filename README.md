_This starcraft AI was developed allongside the tuitorial series given at https://pythonprogramming.net/starcraft-ii-ai-python-sc2-tutorial/
I plan to come back to this project and enhance it with my new machine learning knowledge somepoint soon.

This AI uses OpenCV to plot heatmaps based on the data given by the API (e.h. enemy troop location).
This heatmap is then fed through a large Convolutional Neural Network for many iterations on a GPU.
